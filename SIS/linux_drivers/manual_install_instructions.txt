# NOTE: These are not updated for installing SIS drivers in Ubuntu 14.04 and
above

V. INSTALLING SIS3150 DRIVERS
	a. Drivers are in tarball sisusb-1.2-003.tar.gz
	b. Unzip the tarball to a director with no spaces in the name (else it won't compile)
	d. ./configure --prefix=/your/install/path/SIS --with-usb-headerdir=/usr/include --with-usb-libdir=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu (NOTE: --with-usb-* flags required for
           ubuntu 12.04. Make sure you point them to the right directories. --with-usb flags not required in ubuntu 10.04
           Also, replace the --prefix with the directory you wish to install in. I prefer to use somewhere I have permissions (/home/comp/ instead of /opt/lib for
           instance) so that I don't run into permission issues when compiling
	***for Ubuntu 16.04 use the follow to ./configure to point to correct TCL file.

	./configure --prefix=/your/install/path/SIS --with-usb-headerdir=/usr/include --with-usb-libdir=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --with-tcl-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

	e. make
	f. make install (sudo if your --prefix dir requires root permissions)
	g. Set the rules to automatically give the desired permissions to the USB device (in this example, 777) as follows (http://www.shallowsky.com/blog/linux/kernel/lucid-udev.html)
		cd /etc/udev/rules.d
		sudo your_favorite_text_editor 60-sis3150.rules
		SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1657", ATTR{idProduct}=="3150", MODE="0777"

Va. TESTING SIS3150 DRIVERS - (added by RWB 12/3/12)
	a. Go to directory where you installed the driver (--prefix)
	b. cd into the /bin directory
	c. run the vmeaccess.tcl script (./vmeaccess.tcl)
	d. In upper right panel, you should see an interface that looks something like: "001/003 0x1657 0x3150"
		- If you don't, check that the vme crate is on and plugged into the computer via usb
		- If it is and you still don't, check the linux-install readme of the 1.2-003 drivers for clues
	e. Double click on the interface in the upper-right window. After a few seconds, this should enable the buttons in the rest of the panel
	f. Go to the lower left panel ("single-shot VME transfers").
		- In the Address window, type the base address of one of the 3302 modules. For example, in CCI-2 (and Ge-2)'s current configuration, the 3302 modules start at 0x50000000 and
		  go up like so:
		  0x50000000, 0x58000000, 0x60000000, 0x68000000... etc.
		- If you are unsure about this, see ch. 3 of the SIS 3302 user manual entitled "VME Addressing"
		- Now, add "4" to the end of the hex # to get the "ModuleID. and firmware Revision" register
			- e.g. for the first card, the adress would be: 0x50000004
	g. click the "Read" button. You should get a hex # in the "Data" window where the first 4 #'s represent the module ID (should be 3302) and the last 4 represent the firmware revision
	   (as of 12/12 - either 1408 or 1511 on the 18 CCI-2 SIS3302 modules)
